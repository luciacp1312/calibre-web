## Short Notice from the maintainer 

After 6 years of more or less intensive programming on Calibre-Web, I need a break. 
The last few months, maintaining Calibre-Web has felt more like work than a hobby. I felt pressured and teased by people to solve "their" problems and merge PRs for "their" Calibre-Web. 
I have turned off all notifications from Github/Discord and will now concentrate undisturbed on the development of “my” Calibre-Web over the next few weeks/months.  
I will look into the issues and maybe also the PRs from time to time, but don't expect a quick response from me.
